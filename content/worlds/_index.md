# Welcome to Valeria!
In the land of Valeria, the forces of magic and technology collide in a battle for supremacy. Divided into two regions, the west and east, Valeria is a land of great contrast and diversity, where vast countryside and bustling cities exist side by side. The five major cities of Maleketh, Felgrand, Timmaeus, Boljaw, and Yarlford each have their own unique character and challenges, from the corrupt criminal organizations of Felgrand to the powerful High Families of Maleketh.

**Maleketh, the merchant capital of Valeria,** is where the wealthy and influential High Families reside. The Barlowe family controls the transportation industry, the Megadome family built the city's infrastructure, the Evermont family controls the distribution of wine and alcohol, and the Saka family owns the food and hotel industry. But despite their power and influence, Maleketh is not without its dangers. The High Families are constantly vying for control and dominance, and there are many who would like to see them fall.

**Felgrand, the city of progress,** is a steampunk metropolis run by criminal organizations known as the Syndicates. Their advanced technology and ruthless tactics make Felgrand a dangerous place to be, but also an exciting and unpredictable one. Airships and steam-powered vehicles fill the skies, while hidden dangers lurk in the alleys and backstreets. The players will need to be careful who they trust and who they cross if they hope to survive the dangers of Felgrand.

**Timmaeus, the old monarchy,** is a city steeped in tradition and history. The Purple Dragon Knights, inspired by the ancient dragon Reigedyrth that helped the late Queen Valeria, protect the city and its people from threats both external and internal. The city is home to the headquarters of the knights, making it a center of power and influence. But there are those who would seek to overthrow the monarchy and seize power for themselves, leading to a dangerous game of politics and intrigue.

**Boljaw, the floating city,** is a marvel of engineering and magic. Multiple canals run through the city, which give it the appearance of floating on water. Boljaw is a hub of trade and commerce, with merchants and travelers from all over the world coming to buy and sell their goods. But even the most advanced technology is not without its weaknesses, and the players may find themselves facing unexpected dangers as they explore the city's twisting waterways.

**Yarlford, the vast countryside,** is a place of great natural beauty and danger. The rolling hills and verdant forests are home to all manner of creatures, from peaceful deer and rabbits to dangerous wolves and trolls. The players may need to navigate treacherous terrain and brave fierce weather if they hope to uncover the secrets and treasures hidden in the countryside.

As you journey through Valeria, you will encounter a rich tapestry of characters and creatures, from powerful wizards and cunning thieves to ferocious dragons and mythical beasts. You will need to use all your skills and wits to navigate the dangers and challenges that await you, forging alliances and making enemies along the way. But if you are brave and resourceful, you may just uncover the secrets and treasures that lie hidden in the land of Valeria.
